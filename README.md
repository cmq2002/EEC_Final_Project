#  HCMUT EEC Final Project
## General Information:
- This porject includes the schematic design and PCB layout of a circuit that is able:
  - to measure the current of an 220V AC signal,
  - to set and address to distinguish with other similar circuits, up to 16,
  - to measure the maximum current either up to 5A or up to 10A,
  - to send data to a gateway via RS485 or Wifi or Bluetooth,
  - to display on 7 segment LEDS using IC 74HC595.
 - Besides, it also contain some research on the current sensors technology.
## About the Project Layout:
- EEC_Report.pdf contains the research.
- PCB_1.PcbDoc is the PCB layout for the project.
- SCHEM_1.SchDoc is the schematic design for the project.
